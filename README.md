# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends







* Background
* We made some analysis for Lousie and  comb through the kickstarter campaign data. We made additional columns like parent category, and subcategory to determine which subcategories are in favour more. 
Also just to determine the period of campaigns we created two more columns called date created conversions and date ended conversions. This two ccolumns will tell us for how long the campagns were active, so we can compare data based on their duration.
Also average donationn column gives us an insight that with categories got the most donation, and shows the popularity of a subcategory that can help for fundraising.
