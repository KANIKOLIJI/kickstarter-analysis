# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Background
* We made some analysis for Lousie and combed through the kickstarter campaign data. We made additional columns like parent category, and subcategory to determine which subcategories are in favor more. 
Also just to determine the period of campaigns we created two more columns called date created conversions and date ended conversions. This two columns will tell us for how long the campaigns were active, so we can compare data based on their duration.
Also average donation column gives us an insight that with categories got the most donation, and shows the popularity of a subcategory that can help for fundraising.

## Results 
* In outcomes based on launch date analysis we noticed that in May, June, and July we have the highest rate of successful campaigns for theater, and that shows that around this time of year, theater fundraising will be successful. 
* Also in Dec the number of failed and successful campaigns were almost the same, so it is not a good time of the year for Luisie to start a campaign.
*In outcomes based on goals if goals are not set too big and optimistic, more likely they will be successful. If the goals are set less than 15k, it will be more likely achieved.
