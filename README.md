# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Background
* We made some analysis for Lousie and combed through the kickstarter campaign data. We made additional columns like parent category, and subcategory to determine which subcategories are in favor more. 
Also just to determine the period of campaigns we created two more columns called date created conversions and date ended conversions. This two columns will tell us for how long the campaigns were active, so we can compare data based on their duration.
Also average donation column gives us an insight that with categories got the most donation, and shows the popularity of a subcategory that can help for fundraising.


## Analysis and Challenges
### Chart1
* The most important analysis that we did were comparing outcomes based on launch date and goals. These two factors give us an idea of when and how to start a campaign to be successful. In outcomes based on goals chart, we can see if the goals are set smaller, the rate of being successful is higher. If we choose to set big goals, it will be very challenging and campaign will fail. It is better to consider 50% and higher successful rates, which will be projects in categories less than 15k, but if we go with higher than 15k, we know that the chance of getting failed is higher than 50%.Please refer to the Chart above for more information.

### Chart2

* Also in the chart below we can see that in summer months there is a higher chance of being successful and getting the target goal. As it is shown in the chart, in Dec we have the lowest success rate, so it is better to plan the campaign in Feb to Sep months. There are not so many cancelled campaigns, but if we can turn those canceled campaigns to successful ones, we are definitely going to have higher rates of success, but we need more information on the cancellation reasons.

## Results 
* In outcomes based on launch date analysis we noticed that in May, June, and July we have the highest rate of successful campaigns for theater, 
and that shows that around this time of year, theater fundraising will be successful. 
* Also, in Dec the number of failed and successful campaigns were almost the same, so it is not a good time of the year for Luisie to start a campaign.
* In outcomes based on goals, if goals are not set too big and optimistic, more likely they will be successful. If the goals are set less than 15k, 
it will be more likely achieved.
* If we had some more information on the cancelation, that could help eliminate those factors and turn cancelations to successful campaigns with proper goals set.
